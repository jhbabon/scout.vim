# Scout.vim

Plugin that allows you to use [scout][] inside [neovim][].

You can use [scout][] to quickly find files or buffers and open them in
different windows.

Check the [main documentation](doc/scout.txt) for more info about how to
use it.

## Installation

I recommend you to use a plugin manager.

With [vim-plug][] you can install the plugin like this:

* Add this to your `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

```viml
Plug 'jhbabon/scout.vim'
```

* Install the plugin with the command `:PlugInstall`

## Demo

See [scout][] inside [neovim][] in action:
